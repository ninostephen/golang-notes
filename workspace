This is a agreement on the working folder structure. The below mentioned are the steps.
1. Create a folder, anywhere, any name.
2. Create 3 below mentioned 3 folders in it.
	1. bin - stores the compiled binary
	2. pkg - store the package files. If there is a program that pulls dependencies from various places, then is compiled and stored here. This helps avoid recompiling it and hence save time.
	3. src - source directory for all projects.
3. Under the src directory there will be a domain name and under the domain name a username.
4. Under the username directory all the projects are stored.
GOPATH environment variable points to the workspace path.
GOROOT points to the Golang binary.
